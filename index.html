                                People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living
                                in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                                disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or
                                other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.

                                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation.
                                Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to
                                blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                                Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of
                                the disease that is causing the problem.
